#ssh connectivity 


Create new keys
On each server run:

ssh-keygen

Hit enter enter enter. You'll have two files:

.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/id_rsa.pub



On Server A, cat and copy to clipboard the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[select and copy to your clipboard]



ssh into Server B, and append the contents of that to the it's authorized_keys file:
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[paste your clipboard contents]
[ctrl+d to exit]



Now ssh from server A:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa private.ip.of.other.server



#/etc/ansible/hosts
master ansible_host=ip-172-31-10-76
slave ansible_host=ip-172-31-0-185


#test ssh connectivity with ansible

Use the ping module to ping all the nodes in your inventory:

$ ansible all -m ping


You should see output for each host in your inventory, similar to this:

aserver.example.org | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}


ansible all -m ping -u ubuntu
172.31.40.161 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}


The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts

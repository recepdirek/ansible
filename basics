Use the ping module to ping all the nodes in your inventory:
$ ansible all -m ping

Now run a live command on all of your nodes:
ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"


You should see output for each host in your inventory, similar to this:
aserver.example.org | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}


ansible all -m ping -u ubuntu
172.31.40.161 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}



The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts
